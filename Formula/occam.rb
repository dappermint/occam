  # `brew cleanup` deletes the previous Cellar directory on every upgrade, and
  # launchd pins a bootstrapped job to the inode it resolved rather than to the
  # opt symlink the plist names. The job then dies at launch with
  # OS_REASON_CODESIGNING, not ENOENT, since the replacement binary fails the
  # launch constraint check. Re-bootstrapping is the only fix, and `repair` is
  # a no-op when no agent was ever installed.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      occam needs no permissions, not even from the menu bar agent.

      Start it at login:
        brew services start occam

      Save the headset's current settings so they survive a reconnect:
        occam save --all

      occmixer comes with it. It renders system audio to binaural as it
      plays, and the Spatial tab of the settings window turns it on and off.
